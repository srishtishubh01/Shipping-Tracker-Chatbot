**📘 Smart Shipment Chatbot – Detailed Documentation**
--------

**1. Introduction**
-------

Smart Shipment Chatbot is a web-based conversational application designed to simulate a real-world shipment tracking experience. Instead of using traditional tracking pages, users interact with a chatbot to get updates about their orders.

The chatbot responds in a natural way, remembers tracking IDs, and updates shipment status dynamically based on time progression. This project focuses on usability, realism, and lightweight performance.

**2. Problem Statement**
-------

**Most shipment tracking systems:**

• Are slow to load.

• Have cluttered user interfaces.

• Require users to navigate multiple pages.

• Feel robotic and non-interactive.

• For students and small businesses, building such systems is complex and resource-heavy.

------

**3. Solution Overview**
-------

**Smart Shipment Chatbot solves this problem by:**

• Using a chat-style interface.

• Keeping the UI minimal and fast.

• Simulating shipment progress logically.

• Avoiding backend complexity while still behaving realistically.

• The system works completely on the frontend using JavaScript, making it easy to deploy and understand.

-------

**4. Functional Flow**
-------

• User opens the application.

• User enters a tracking ID or asks a question like:

• “Where is my order?”

• “Track my package”

**The chatbot:**

• Validates the tracking ID.

• Saves it in memory.

• Generates order and shipment details.

• Shipment status is calculated dynamically.

**The chatbot replies with:**

• Current shipment stage.

• City/location.

• Expected delivery (only if not delivered).

• On future searches with the same ID, progress continues forward.

------

**5. Shipment Lifecycle Logic**
-------

**The chatbot follows a realistic shipment flow:**

• Order Placed

• Dispatched

• In Transit

• Out for Delivery

• Delivered
