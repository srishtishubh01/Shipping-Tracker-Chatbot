 **Smart Shipment Chatbot**
 ------
 
**📌 Overview**
-------

Smart Shipment Chatbot is a lightweight, conversational web application that allows users to track their shipment using a simple chat interface. Instead of browsing complex tracking pages, users can directly ask questions like “Where is my order?” or enter a tracking ID to instantly receive shipment updates.

This project focuses on simplicity, realism, and user experience, simulating how real logistics chatbots work in e-commerce platforms.

--------
**🎯 Why This Project?**
---------

Most shipment trackers feel mechanical and static. This project was built to explore how conversation-based interfaces can make tracking easier, faster, and more user-friendly—especially for students and small-scale systems.

The chatbot remembers previous tracking IDs, calculates shipment progress based on order date, and responds naturally, making it feel more human than a traditional tracker.
